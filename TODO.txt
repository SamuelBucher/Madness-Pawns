Missing (and presumably freshly lost) eye sprite is still drawn. Maybe I can ignore it (no I can't).

Testing:


Spritework:
Red eyes
Grey eyes
Bionic eye
Archotech eye
Missing eye(?)


Long term goals:
Hair
Beards
Tattoos
Revise old sprites

Draw both eye hediffs on the side view (eye genes are symetric, messing with scaling might work)
Female specific head option (requires missing eyes to work)
