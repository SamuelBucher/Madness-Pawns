Missing (and presumably freshly lost) eye sprite is still drawn. Maybe I can ignore it.

Testing:


Spritework:
Red eyes
Grey eyes
Bionic eye
Archotech eye
Missing eye(?)


Long term goals:
Hair
Beards
Tattoos
Revise old sprites

Female specific head option
Draw both eye hediffs on the side view (eye genes are symetric, messing with scaling might work)
