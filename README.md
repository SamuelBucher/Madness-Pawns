# Madness-Pawns
A Madness Combat themed mod for RimWorld.
![Thumbnail](/"Steam page images"/Options.png)

## Features
Makes RimWorld's human pawns look like grunts from Madness Combat. Everyone will have the same body and head type, with no hair (but beards remain). Bodily apparel has been retextured to accommodate that.
There are also options to:
- Toggle hair rendering for men and/or women (may look wonky, espetially on side views);
- Use the vanilla female body for women;
- Use the vanilla thin body instead of standard grunt body (for modded apparel compatability).
Options to toggle hair rendering and RimWorld's vanilla female body for female pawns or thin body for males/everyone (for mod combatability) are present.
**Inspired by the Newgrounds animated series Madness Combat by Krinkels, make sure to check it out.**

## Compatibity
Incompatible with my other mod, RimBald, and its older versions (obviously).
Any modded bodily apparel may look really out of place.
Might have issues with mods that change how pawns render. Please report any incompatibilities you find.
Save file friendly, as it doesn't mess with anything's data, just the pawn rendering process and some difs.
May God have mercy on your soul if you try to use this mod along with Facial Animation.

## Recommended mods
- [Show Me Your Hands](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2475965842) - gives pawns those iconic disembodied grunt hands;
- [HD Pawn Rendering](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2538746878) - my mod's textures are 256x256, but Rimworld limits the render resolution for pawns to 128x128. This mod fixes that.

## Long term goals
- Retexture hair, beards, and tattoos to better accomodate the grunt look.
